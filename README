Project 3: Wiretap

IMPLEMENTED BY : Puneet Loya(username: ploya) and Suprith Chandrashekharachar(username: suprchan)

The project is implemented in C++11.

The code is located in a single file.

wiretap.cpp  - The main file which file which initiates the program and analyses a given pcap file.

Required Files:

wiretap.cpp 
makefile

Tasks Accomplished:

- Open a pcap file using pcap_open_offline
- Check if the pcap was captured on a ethernet interface
- For every pcap,
	- Get link layer statistics
	- Get network layer statistics
	- Get transport statistics
- Print the output to the console
	
System Requirements:

C++ Compiler : g++/4.7.2 OR g++/4.8

Operating System : Ubuntu14.04/Redhat

Compiling:

If executing on a silo.cs.indiana.edu machine, please make sure you execute the below command at the shell prompt:

	module load gcc/4.7.2

A makefile is provided to compile the program. 

Just cd to the directory containing all files related to the project. Please refer the above section to find which all files are required.

Execute by typing in "make" at the shell prompt.

Refer the makefile for more details.

Usage:

--help. Example: “./wiretap --help”.
--open <capture file to open>. Example: “./wiretap --open capture.pcap”.

Examples to run the program: 

To run the program: /wiretap --open wget.pcap

Sample Output:
